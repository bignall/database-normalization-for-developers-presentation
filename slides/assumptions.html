        <li>It probably isn't a stretch at this conference to say we are all Development Professionals.
            And most of us work with databases all the time too. 
            So You probably wouldn't be here if you weren't ;)
        </li>
        <li>At least you should know something of the normal forms and be familiar 
            with the language of theory. If not you're welcome to stay but it 
            may be hard to understand. I suggest 
            you go take a class in database theory or read a book or two (I'll 
            suggest some at the end).
